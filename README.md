# Make the new Twitter suck less
This is a Chrome extension you can install locally to remove the distracting side-bar from Twitter. If you want to search, you can change the permissions for the thing (or make your own version).

## To Install
Clone this directory, then go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser and "Load unpacked". This will install the extension and you should not see the right side bar when you navigate to Twitter. Happy browsing!
